# Filter-suggestion-based-on-prediction-of-water-quality-using-AI-ML
This project addresses the need for an effective water quality prediction system by leveraging AI&ML  real-time data is collected using a custom hardware setup equipped with four sensors measuring key parameters: pH, temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and turbidity. The collected data is analyzed using various ML algorithms, including regression, classification, and time-series forecasting, to accurately predict water quality. 
Based on these predictions, the system recommends suitable water filters to ensure optimal water quality. By integrating real-time data collection with advanced ML techniques, the project aims to improve water management practices and effectively address challenges related to water contamination.
